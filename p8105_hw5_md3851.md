Problem 1
---------

Loading Iris dataset

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species)) %>% 
  view()
```

Tidying Iris dataset

``` r
cleaning = function(x) {
  
   if(is.numeric(x)) {
   replace_na(x, round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)))
   }
   else if (is.character(x)) 
     {replace_na(x, "virginica")}
}

output = map_dfr(.x = iris_with_missing, ~ cleaning(.x), .id = "input")
output 
```
